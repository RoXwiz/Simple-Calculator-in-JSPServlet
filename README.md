# Simple Calculator using JSP and Servlet

Creating a simple calculator using JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlet is a great way to demonstrate the basic functionality of web applications in Java. In this project, we will build a web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Description

### Objective

To create a web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations.

### Technologies Used

- Java
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- Servlet
- HTML
- CSS (optional for styling)

## Project Features

1. **User Interface:** Design a simple and user-friendly web interface for the calculator using HTML and CSS. You can create input fields, buttons for digits and operations, and a display area to show the result.

2. **Servlet:** Create a Servlet to handle user requests and perform the calculations. The Servlet should be responsible for parsing user input, executing the requested operation, and sending the result back to the JSP page.

3. **JSP Page:** Create a JSP page that serves as the calculator's user interface. The JSP page should contain HTML for the layout and form elements for user input. When users click buttons or submit the form, the JSP page should send the data to the Servlet for processing.

4. **Operations:** Implement the basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

5. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to deal with invalid input, such as dividing by zero or non-numeric input.

## Project Flow

1. User visits the web page (the JSP page) where the calculator is displayed.

2. User enters numbers and selects an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /).

3. User clicks the "Calculate" button or presses an "Equals" key.

4. The JSP page sends the user's input to the Servlet.

5. The Servlet parses the input, performs the calculation, and sends the result back to the JSP page.

6. The JSP page displays the result on the screen.

## Project Implementation Steps

1. Create a Java web project in your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

2. Design the user interface using HTML and CSS.

3. Create a Servlet to handle user requests and perform calculations.

4. Create a JSP page for the calculator interface.

5. Implement the logic for parsing user input and performing calculations in the Servlet.

6. Handle errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid input.

7. Test the calculator thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

8. Deploy the web application to a web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).

9. Share the URL of the calculator with users.

## Project Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add support for more advanced operations like square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions.

2. Implement history or memory functions to store previous calculations.

3. Add a clear button to reset the calculator.

4. Improve the user interface by adding more styling and responsiveness.

By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with JSP and Servlets and have a functional web-based calculator that you can use and showcase to others.
